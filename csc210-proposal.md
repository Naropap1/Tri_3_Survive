Project: Tri 3 Survive

Our project will be a simple multiplayer shooter game. As the title may suggest, a user plays as a triangle in the same "world" as all other users of the site. The goal of the game is to earn points by shooting other players and to not be shot. Points scored will be based on how many points the other player had, and all points will be lost upon being shot. Colors may be used to signify current points to other players.

Our project is a web application aimed at people who enjoy playing simple games to pass time, and is intended to solve their boredom.

In order to satisfy the project requirements, users will be able to create an account, which will allow us to store lifetime stats on a certain player (ex. total deaths, points, etc.) which can be viewed at any time by the user. Updates will be made as necessary. Users will also have the option to delete their account or reset their data.

This is interesting beyond the minimum requirements because it allows users to actually play a game on top of being able to create, read, update, and modify data.
