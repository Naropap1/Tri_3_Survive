Project: Tri 3 Survive

Our project will be a simple multiplayer shooter game. As the title may suggest, a user plays as a triangle in the same "world" as all other users of the site. The goal of the game is to earn points by shooting other players and to not be shot. Points will be rewarded upon kills and scale depending on how many points the player killed had. All points will be lost upon being shot. Colors may be used to signify current points to other players. To honor the people who dedicate the most to our game, a leader board will be created.

Our project is a web application aimed at people who enjoy playing simple games to pass time and is intended to solve their boredom.

In order to satisfy the project requirements, users will be able to create an account, which will allow us to store lifetime stats on a certain player (ex. total deaths, points, etc.) which can be viewed at any time by the user. Updates will be made as necessary. Users will also have the option to delete their account or reset their data. Information can also be used to produce a leader board between all existing users. Fianally, We plan to create the game useing WebSockets. 

Tri 3 survive is a unique Web Application because there are not many first person shooter games that are both multiplayer and have minimilized graphics. What also makes this game unique is how unforgiving the rules are. One shot you're dead. Highstakes multiplayer video games challenges your reflexes to the upmost level. These are the reasons we hope Tri 3 survive would stand out from other games on internet. Of course, a game this innovated goes beyond just meeting the minimal requirments in a course (being able to create, read, update, and modify data).
